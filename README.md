# line_follower_with_ROS
This code will help through understanding ROS (Robotic Operating System) by implementing it on a line follower.
It helps in understanding how to implement Publisher node and Subscriber node in ROS. 

Here I am taking Inputs from 5 array IR sensors and encoding that data in Infr(information) and publishing it.
The subsciber node subscibes the data and decodes the data. With the decoded data outputs(motors) were driven.

Here our aim is not to make a line follower but to understand ROS. For etter undrstanding we made it to work on a line follower.
